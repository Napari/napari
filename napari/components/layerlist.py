        layers are written to unique files in the folder.

        If ``plugin`` is provided and a single layer is targeted, then we
        call the ``napari_write_<layer_type>`` for that plugin, and if it fails
        we error.

        ----------
        path : str
            A filepath, directory, or URL to open.  Extensions may be used to

        plugin : str, optional
