Announcement: napari 0.2.3
==========================

We're happy to announce the release of napari v0.2.3!
napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.
It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional
images. It's built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-base
rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).
