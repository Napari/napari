# Our mission

`napari` aims to be the multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. We accomplish this by:

- being **easy to use and install**. We are careful in taking on new
  dependencies, and sometimes cull existing ones, or make them optional. All
  functions in our API have thorough docstrings clarifying expected inputs and
  outputs.
- being **highly performant** and **interative**.
- providing a **consistent API**.
- promoting **education in image processing**, with extensive pedagogical
  documentation.

# Our values
----------

- We are inclusive. We continue to welcome and mentor newcomers who are
  making their first contribution.
